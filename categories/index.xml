This is powerful and pretty flexible, but sometimes you want something more lightweight and don&amp;rsquo;t need to use the network stack (because you are connecting two services running under the same machine).
This is were UDS (UNIX Domain Sockets) can serve as an inter-process communication mechanism between your two services, allowing you to bypass the overhead of the TCP/IP protocol.</description></item></channel></rss>
